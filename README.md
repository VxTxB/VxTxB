- 👋 Hi, I’m @VxTxB
- 👀 I’m interested in Reverse Engineering, Customized Malwares, Virus, Trojans and Malicious Programs for specific private uses. Not interested in publishing anything public unless if it could be used by many people. Probably small snippets!!!
- 🌱 I’m always learning OS internals. Everyday is a new day!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on such projects
- 📫 How to reach me through Github / X.com <search me there. Fairly easy to find me!>
